# Pinal County Building Permit Application Analysis
In this project I used data from the Permit feature class that I had created as a component of the automated permit application review process. I used the Single Family Home area values and the Building permit application Submit Date values. I removed null and duplicate records and undesired columns, filled missing data, and removed outliers to prepare the dataset for statistical analysis and visualization. I used pandas and numpy libraries to create Pie chart, histogram graph , box plot, heat map, and scatter plot. Per this analysis, there was not a significant trend in size of Single Family Homes in Pinal County during the timeframe of 1/2019 to 3/2021.
